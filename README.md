TrackFyre: Users select a component of a website that they want to track changes in (using a Chrome extension). Our app sends the user an email when the component changes.

Cool features:
User friendly interface - selecting a section of a website is as simple as clicking on it!
Robust - If the component selected moves around in the page, our app still tracks changes in the component.

Sample use cases:
Tracking product prices on Amazon.
Checking for a star's profile update.
Updates to a product catalogue.
Notified when an appointment slot (in say a clinic) opens up.
